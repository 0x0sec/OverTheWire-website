Kishi (HES2013 and NSC2013)
===========================
{% include beginNote.html title="2013-10-29 - kishi is down" %}
The kishi wargame is down because of hardware constraints. At this point, we're not sure whether it will come back or be released as a liveCD.
{% include endNote.html %}

This wargame was introduced at the [Hackito Ergo Sum (HES)][HES] 2013 and [No Such Con (NSC)][NSC] 2013 conferences in Paris and is centered around
the **fictictious North-Korean cyberops training facility Kishi**

The wargame has its own website [here][Kishi].
