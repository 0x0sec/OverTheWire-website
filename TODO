Hall of fame
------------
   Some application where people can somehow register that they finished a wargame level. This data can then be viewed online with statistics(?)
   And the data can also be added to the forum profile.

Fark-style board
----------------
   Like the old portal.overthewire.org, a place where users can post links with a snappy deascription and a tag showing the type of link. Comments could be posted on the forum.
   An IRC-bot logging links for use on this fark-style board would also be handy.

Wiki/Forum IRC-bot
------------------
   An IRC-bot that logs changes to Wiki and Forum to an IRC-channel.

Centralised account registration
--------------------------------
   A site that can register useraccounts (with OpenID authn) and that will register the same username on a number of other components (wiki, forum, ...).
   That way we can disable the registration process on all components, require only a single registration per user and use OpenID for everything.
