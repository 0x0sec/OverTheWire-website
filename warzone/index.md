Warzone
========

The warzone is an isolated network simulating the entire IPv4 Internet, on
which all connected devices are targets to be hacked. Unlike other wargames,
the warzone allows players to connect their own hackable servers or devices
with any software they like, as long as it speaks IP.

The warzone setup gives us the ability to create wargames that are far more
interesting than the ones currently online, such as a games based on
Windows/Android/<enter wacky OS here>, kernel exploitation, advanced network
exploitation, etc.

Currently, we are gathering feedback on the warzone to help steer its development.

To make the place more interesting, we have created a setup (named tsutomu)
that encourages you to recreate the Mitnick Attack in real life.  More
information on tsutomu can be be found at <http://172.16.66.66> once you are
connected to the warzone.

You may find it helpful to coordinate with others working on tsutomu, to avoid
getting in each others way. To do that, once you are signed up for the warzone,
please join the #wargames channel on ircs.overthewire.org (SSL).

To sign up for the warzone, visit <https://draco.overthewire.org> and ignore the
invalid certificate for now.
